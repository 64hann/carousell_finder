# Carousell Search Filter
As a frequent user of Carousell, I often found my search results in Carousell irrelevant and many of them not within my budget. Thus, I built a project to filter my results based on heading and price.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To get this project running, you will need to install the latest version of Python.
```
Install Python 3.8
```
You will also need to install external Python packages using the pip command
